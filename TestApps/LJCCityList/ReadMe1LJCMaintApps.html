  <h4 id="list">Initial "List" Page</h4>
  <p>
    An LJC Maintenance web app contains a dynamically created HTML Table "List"
    for displaying and paging through the main source or table items. In this
    document it is often referred to as a "Maint" app.
  </p>
  <p>
    The page contains controls for selecting the parent record if the table has
    a parent table or tables. The list displays the items that belong to the
    selected parent record.
  </p>
  <p>
    The maint app name uses the name of the main item source or table as in:
    "LJCCity".
  </p>
  <p>
    The initial list page of a maint app is named for the app as in:
    "LJCCityList.html"
  </p>
  <p>
    The parent tables usually have separate maint apps to reduce complexity.
  </p>
  <!--  -->
  <h4 id="listEvents">List Events Script</h4>
  <p>
    The list page event initialization and handlers are defined in a separate
    JavaScript file that is named for the list page as in:
    "LJCCityListEvents.js".
  </p>
  <p>
    This file handles common events for the list page. However, HTML Tables and
    other significant items that have many events or large event handlers are
    defined in separate files.
  </p>
  <p>
    The list events class is named "LJCCityListEvents".
  </p>
  <p>
    The list events class contains a reference to an LJCTable object named
    CityTable.
  </p>
  <p>
    The list events class creates the table events script and contains the
    reference object named CityTableEvents.
  </p>
  <!--  -->
  <h4 id="tableObject">The LJCTable object</h4>
  <p>
    The LJCTable object contains the state of the HTML table such as the current
    row index and paging state such as the beginning and end of data flags and
    the current row keys.
  </p>
  <p>
    The LJCTable object also contains functions for accessing and manipulating
    HTML table elements.
  </p>
  <!--  -->
  <h4 id="tableEvents">Table Events Script</h4>
  <p>
    The event initialization and handlers for the list HTML table are defined in
    a separate JavaScript file that is named for the list HTML table as in:
    "LJCCityTableEvents.js".
  </p>
  <p>
    The table events class constructor requires several parameters. It takes an
    LJCCityTableEventsArgs object with the main parameter values, instead of
    receiving each parameter separately
  </p>
  <p>
    The table events file handles table paging, context menu display, context
    menu item selection and other functions directly related to the list HTML
    table.
  </p>
  <p>
    The table events class is named "LJCCityTableEvents".
  </p>
  <p>
    The private method "#AddEvents()" adds the events for displaying the
    context menu and handling the menu items.
  </p>
  <p>
    The list HTML table is created dynamically. Therefore, the HTML table
    specific events must be recreated each time the HTML table is created.<br />
    A separate private method "#AddTableEvents()" exists for this purpose.
  </p>
  <!--  -->
  <h4 id="tableService">Table Web Service</h4>
  <p>
    The table web service is a PHP web service that creates HTML table text from
    a database table.
  </p>
  <p>
    For a maint app, it is called from the table events object.
  </p>
  <!--  -->
  <h4 id="detailEvents">Detail Events Script</h4>
  <p>
    The event initialization and handlers for the detail dialog are defined in a
    separate JavaScript file named LJCCityDetailEvents.js.
  </p>
  <p>
    The detail events class is named "LJCCityDetailEvents".
  </p>
  <!--  -->
  <h4 id="dataService">Data Web Service</h4>
  <p>
    The data web service is a PHP web service for accessing a database table. It
    provides Add, Delete, Retrieve and Update functionality.
  </p>
  <p>
    For a maint app, it is generally called from the detail events object.
