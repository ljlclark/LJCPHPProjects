1. Configure IIS

Control Panel | Programs | Turn Windows features on or off

Check Internet Information Services
Check IIS | World Wide Web Services | Application Development Features | CGI
OK

2. Install the NTS (non-thread safe) 64-bit version of PHP

Download and save onto the machine:

http://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-7.x.x-nts-Win32-VC14-x64.zip

Extract all the contents of the zip file to C:\PHP

Now edit the System PATH variable so IIS knows where the PHP executables are:

Control Panel | System and Security | System | Advanced System Settings
Environment Variables
System Variables | Path | Edit
New -> C:\PHP

3. Configure the php.ini file. This is the part you’d never figure out without some help.

Make a copy of file C:\PHP\php.ini-development and save it as C:\PHP\php.ini

Edit file php.ini by finding the following entries, uncomment them, and change values to:

1. fastcgi.impersonate = 1
2. cgi.fix_pathinfo = 0
3. cgi.force_redirect = 0
4. open_basedir = “C:\inetpub\wwwroot”
5. extension_dir = “ext”
6. error_log=”php_errors.log”
7. uncomment the 24 Windows Extensions entries:

extension=php_bz2.dll
extension=php_curl.dll
extension=php_fileinfo.dll
extension=php_ftp.dll
extension=php_gd2.dll
extension=php_gettext.dll
extension=php_gmp.dll
extension=php_intl.dll
extension=php_imap.dll
extension=php_interbase.dll
extension=php_ldap.dll
extension=php_mbstring.dll
extension=php_exif.dll
extension=php_mysqli.dll
extension=php_oci8_12c.dll
extension=php_openssl.dll
extension=php_pdo_firebird.dll
extension=php_pdo_mysql.dll
extension=php_pdo_oci.dll
extension=php_pdo_odbc.dll
extension=php_pdo_pgsql.dll
extension=php_pdo_sqlite.dll
extension=php_pgsql.dll
extension=php_shmop.dll

Save the edited php.ini file.

4. Configure IIS to work with PHP

Run | inetmgr
Handler Mappings | Add Module Mapping

Request path: *.php
Module: FastCgiModule (from the dropdown)
Executable (optional): C:\PHP\php-cgi.exe
Name: FastCGI

OK (Yes)

5. Test the installation and configuration

Launch Notepad with Administrative privleges.
Create a file test.php and save it at C:\inetpub\wwwroot.

Now launch a browser and navigate to

http://localhost/test.php
