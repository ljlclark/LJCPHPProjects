      These projects were used by myself to learn PHP. With several decades of full time development in C#, quite a bit of experience
      with C and some exposure to C++; my coding is heavily influenced by strongly typed, object oriented languages and Pascal case
      and Camel case names. To help keep things familiar for me it will be noticed that much of this influence has been brought forward
      to my code in PHP.
