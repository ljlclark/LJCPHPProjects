# LJCPHPProjects
I used these projects to learn PHP. I have several decades of experience in C, C# and some exposure to C++; so my
experience is heavily influenced by strongly typed and object oriented languages. Also Pascal case and Camel cased
names. To help keep things familiar for me it will be noticed that I have brought much of this experience forward
to my code in PHP.
