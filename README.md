# LJCPHPProjects
These projects were used by myself to learn PHP. With several decades of full time development in C#; quite a bit of experience
with C and some exposure to C++; my coding is heavily influenced by strongly typed and object oriented languages. Also Pascal
case and Camel case names. To help keep things familiar for me it will be noticed that much of this influence has been brought
forward to my code in PHP.

LJCPHPCodeDoc
One of my first projects was to write a CodeDoc generator in PHP to read my PHP files and generate CodeDoc HTML. These CodeDoc
pages are found in the WebSites repository folder LJCPHPCodeDoc.

LJCCommonLib.php
There are certain functions that are used in multiple projects. These are coded as static functions in LJCCommonLib.
