		<summary>Represents a template Section.</summary>
		<remarks>
			A Section identifies a section of text for which there can be one or more
			items.
			&lt;p&gt;
			The text within the Section will be generated once for each Item identified
			in the XMLData file. The Replacements for the current Item are applied to
			the text.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			A Section can appear within another Section but must not cross Section
			borders. The active Replacements will be for the current Item and the
			parent tree current Items. That is for all current Items in which the
			current section is enclosed.
